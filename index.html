  Hey there! I have decided to move to Jekyll for my website! I know it sucks to see a website WIP. 

 Why Jekyll? 
 It's very well framed. In addition, it is new to me and sounds very exciting!
 Integration of LaTeX, and super easy posts integration along with github hosting is awesome!

 Will be back as soon as possible!
